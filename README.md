# Python Turtle Games

This project features two games developed using Python's Turtle module:

1. **Space Wars**  
   A space-themed game where players control a spaceship and fight off enemies. The game includes sound effects for various events.

2. **Snake**  
   A classic Snake game where players control a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions.

## Project Structure

### Snake

- `death.mp3`: Sound effect for when the snake dies.
- `fruit.mp3`: Sound effect for collecting fruit.
- `highscore.txt`: File to store the high score.
- `playsound.py`: Script for handling sound playback.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the Snake game.
- `snake.py`: Main script for the Snake game.

### Space Wars

- `crash.mp3`: Sound effect for when the spaceship crashes.
- `explosion.mp3`: Sound effect for explosions.
- `high.txt`: File to store the high score.
- `missile.mp3`: Sound effect for shooting missiles.
- `playsound.py`: Script for handling sound playback.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for the Space Wars game.
- `space.gif`: Image used in the Space Wars game.
- `spacewars.py`: Main script for the Space Wars game.

## How to Run

1. **Snake Game**  
   Navigate to the `snake` folder and run the game with:
   ```bash
   python snake.py

2. **Space Wars**  
   Navigate to the `snake` folder and run the game with:
   ```bash
   python spacewars.py

## Requirements

1. Each game has its own `requirements.txt` file for managing dependencies. Ensure you install the necessary libraries for each game by running:
   ```bash
   python snake.py

Replace `<folder>` with either `snake` or `space_wars`.
